Although their primary goal is visualization, they effectively perform a **projection from an n-dimensional space to a 2D space**, which is a core idea in dimensionality reduction.\n",

        "The authors generally prefer **Star Coordinates (SC)** over **RadViz** for the following two key reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. RadViz introduces nonlinear distortions that hinder data interpretation**  \n",
        "RadViz includes a **normalization step** that turns the projection into a nonlinear mapping. This step can **distort the geometry** of the data in several ways:\n",

        "\n",
        "**2. SC allows more flexibility and supports linear mappings like PCA or LDA**  \n",

        "- **Better class or cluster separation**, especially in classification tasks.\n",
        "\n",
